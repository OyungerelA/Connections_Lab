# Connections_Lab Project One
Project 1 - Create a web application that utilizes both a data set. The data you incorporate can be static or dynamic. Your web page should include at least a .html file, a .css file and a .js file. At least one user interaction is required. The interaction could be a user providing input to make a specific data request, a user affecting the webpage, or a user doing something else.

## Project Plan

### Inspiration
After giving some more thoughts, I decided to change my project idea to one that I felt more excited about. When I was back home, we (me and my family) always faced a big question every evening: "What to cook for dinner?". Some days this question would get resolved quite quickly, as there would be dish that we craved and wanted to make. But in other days, we would spend a long time thinking about the possible dishes we could make given available ingredients and ultimately decide on making a dish we already know how to make. In these thought-filled evenings, I rarely consulted a cooking recipe website, mostly because of my previous not-so pleasant experiences with using a recipe websites. Most of the well-known websites are usually packed with too much information, from attention-deviating ads and difficult navigation bars to complex and long recipes on the main page that are irrelavant to the users' needs and wants. When a user is visiting the website for specific reasons, for example when seeking only the recipes using a certain ingredient, then being presented food and health articles, cocktail recipes, newsletter sign-up popup ads or kitchen equipment reviews is unnecessary, time-consuming and can often make the user experience less satifying and more tedious, as in the case of my own example. Therefore, my motivation for this project came from my personal experience and the desire to create an effortless and straightforward website that the user can easily search for recipes based on the ingredient they want to use, without being bombarded with irrelevant information and a crowded user interface. 

I expect my target audience to be people who regularly cook and are wishing to learn new recipes using the food items they have, but don't have a lot of time/interest in their hands to surf through large-scale cooking recipe websites. They could be working mothers/fathers, busy college students, anyone trying to experiment with different ingredients and those who prefer distractionless web visiting experience. 

It is important to think about how my web application can differ from other existing great recipe websites and what new features it can bring to the table. As mentioned, I plan to focus on creating a user interface that is free of distractions, effortless to use and bring to the user exactly the information they want and nothing more, nothing unnecessary. To reach this goal, my website will have a landing page with only a search bar that will ask the user to input a main ingredient they want to use in their dish and depending on what they input, different recipes will be shown down on the webpage where the user can click on and read the instructions about. By not having random food recipes and only having the search bar on the landing page, I expect the experience to be more intuitive and straightforward to use.
