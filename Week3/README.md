# Connections_Lab_Week3
Week 3 HW - Make an initial version of your project where data is displayed on the page either on page load or as a result of a user interaction.

## Updated Project Plan



## Planning
Coming up an idea for this project was very challenging. Although I had some ideas for web applications using data fetched from an API, for instance a book search app where the user inputs a genre and I display info on the current bestsellers with that genre, I was not entirely sure how I was going to use p5.js in visualizing the data in such applications. My thinking was that it would make more sense to use a dataset with meaningful numbers so I can use the values to create visualizations. Thus, I tried to look for datasets where the central data consists of number values. While browsing through different datasets and APIs, I came across a [website](https://ourworldindata.org/internet) that had a variety of information about the internet, its users, different applications that are used frequently etc. From there, I found data on some of the most used social media applications with their total user number and how much of the world's population use them by age group. I thought this would make a good topic to do my project on, as we all spend so much time on the internet, on social media and knowing data on knowing about its usage would be informative as well as thought-provoking. It would relay information on the connectedness of our world and the power of technology and social media in bringing people together. 

As my dataset is informative and quite applicable to everyone using the web, I consider my target audience to be all the people on the web hoping to learn more about social media applications and their usage globally. Since my app is for a wide range of people, I hope to make the design for my web app simple and intuitive to use, creating not only aesthetically pleasing but also straightforward and minimalist structure and design.  


## Process
The dataset I will be using contains the user information data on 5 social media applications, namely the number of users (as of 2019) and how much portion of each group (5 groups: 18-24, 25-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65+) use each application. I intend to create a circle visualization of each app, where the size/radius of the circle is determined by the relative size of the app or the number of users. In other words, the higher the number of users it has, the larger the circle will be representing the app. I also plan to add animations to the circle replicating a heart-beat (or the circle getting smaller and larger slowly and traces being left behind), to give the users the idea that these apps are alive and dynamic. I don't know how exactly I will do this as I don't have experience working with p5.js but I'll learn to make it during our workshops and by using Youtube videos.

In terms of structure and design, the screen will be divided into two parts where the left-half will consist of the circles and the other half will be for textual information or the chart-like representations of users in terms of age-group. When the users hovers on the circle, the color of the circle will change (or other animation I will decide later on) and when the users presses on it, the heading will be changed and the later half of the screen will display information of the app represented by that circle. At this moment, my idea is still quite rough and I really hope I can get feedback from professor and my peers so I can make improvements. At this moment, I'm also debating whether to add more data onto the dataset, as right now, it only holds two types of information. I'll continue to give it more thought, but as of right now, this is the plan that I have.

## Next Steps
For now, I have only fetched the data from my dataset and displayed it on my website. So my next steps would be to create the skeleton of my website, by making the respective containers and playing around with how I want my data to be exhibited. I'm a bit worried about my web application becoming too much of a data visualization page rather than a "web application", so I'll continue to give more thought on what interactions I could add to my webpage so that it becomes a more comprehensive and complete application that not only visualizes data but also gives the users a chance to interact with the data.
